For the first few days, the uncle showed him the usual things - chickens, cows, crops, etc. After three days, however, it was obvious that the nephew was getting bored, and the uncle was running out of things to amuse him with. Finally, the uncle decided to give them a real treat. 'Why don't you grab a gun, take my prized hunting dogs, and go have some fun shooting?' This seemed to cheer the nephew up, and with enthusiasm, off he went, dogs in trail. After a few hours, the nephew returned. 'How did you enjoy that?' asked the uncle. 'It was great!' exclaimed the nephew. 'Got any more dogs?'"
  }
}
